| Availability | It represent the availability of the application. we can calculate it by the following formula SLI =  no. of successful requests / total no. of requests                                   | 99%                                                                                                         |
| Latency      | Latency is how fast you want your application to respond. we can represent this as SLI =  90th percentile latency over a 10 min period.                                                    | 90% of requests below 100ms                                                                                 |
| Error        | It represents that How much your infrastructure can be down? we can calculate error budget by the following formula SLI = the number of error requests/total number of requests in budget. | Error budget is defined at 20%. This means that 20% of the requests can fail and still be within the budget |
| Throughput   | It measures how many loads your site can handle. We can represent this as SLI =  total number of requests over a period of time                                                            | 5 RPS indicates the application is functioning                                                              |
